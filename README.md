# XOXO 

  is the sexier version of our familiar TIC - TAC - TOE game. 
  
  **launch it [here](https://cnapaswan.github.io/xoxo/)**

  My determination behind this game was to make it user-friendly, beautiful and definitely properly function.  The popping up area is the board for 2 players to place their 'X' or 'O' symbols, the player who manages to place their symbol across the board in horizontal, diagonal and vertical line first will be named the 'WINNER'. Once a player win, there would be a declaration popping up in the middle of the board for players to restart a new game.
